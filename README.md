ESPkit-01 - The breakout board for learning ESP-01's
=============

This project is designed as an easy to use adapter to connect your ESP-01 device to a standard serial connection.

Version 1.3 has expanded and now includes a full usb-to-serial chip right on the board.  If you'd prefer the simpiler version, follow this link to [Version 1.2](https://github.com/mage0r/ESPkit-01/tree/v1.2).

It has a program/general use button and a ws2812b to play with some blinky leds.  To enable the ws2812b, simply bridge the "pixel on" pads.
